# E-LGSGM

This is an end of course project on Introduction to Deep Learning. The project is largely based on the works on LGSGM

This directory contains two separate folders.

## Feature Extractor directory

this directory contains code for extracting visual features. Download and place the data folder in the LGSGM directory

## LGSGM

This contains code for either training the model or evaluating or pretrained model. It requires both a Report directory which contains the pretrained model. Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DR_MUr_A1XBZLGDNO3mi0FqDoTZTE8iZ/view?usp=drive_link). The LGSGM model also require the preproced data and the visual features for training. Download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e9ko0xnKEDl-OQ36So5Wq11zSPlimK_2/view?usp=drive_link)

Kinly put both Data and Report directories here. Also, to evaluate only our pretrained model, you dont need to extract the visual features. The preprocessed data in the Data directory is enough.
